# JavaScript Practice Project from codingphase.com

As a subscription member of codingphase.com, I decided to further develop my JavaScript skills utilizing the Practical Javascript Course developed by Joe Santos. I found his teaching styles and methods to be impeccable. His ease with turning complex concepts into an enjoyable learning experience has certainly been the highlight of the time I've spent completing each scenario.
